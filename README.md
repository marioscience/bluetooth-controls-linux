# bluetooth-controls-linux
Modules to use controls from bluetooth headphones. Start/stop, volume up/down, skip next/previous. Use to control music.google.com. Might need an extension for that too. 

/dev/input13 is current input buffer in my local machine. use raw for now. identify automatically later.
